# IncLSTM: Incremental Ensemble LSTM Model towards Time Series Data

# For the whole program
This is my recurrent code for the paper [IncLSTM: Incremental Ensemble LSTM Model towards Time Series Data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045790621001592)

# This code isn't complete yet, I will continue to complete this code (maybe)

# Environment

1. Python v3.7
2. tensordlow 1.14.0
3. scikit-learn 1.0.2
